  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>HTML comments are the way to add notes to the html code that are not displayed on the browser.
    The HTML comments can be displayes by < !- - and - -> tags<br>
      < !- - This is a comment - ->
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        The comments can be used for varity of purposes such as<br>
        ->Explaining the purpose of a particular piece of code<br>
        ->Documenting the code for future reference<br>
        ->Leaving notes to yourself or other developers<br>
        ->Hiding code that you do not want to be displayed in the browser<br>
        The comments are a valuable tool for making your HTML code more readable and maintainable. They can help you to
        understand your code better and to make changes more easily.<br>
        HTML comments can be nested, but only to a depth of 7 levels.<br>
        HTML comments can be multi-line, but they must be terminated with a --> tag on each line.<br>
        HTML comments can be used to hide code from the browser, but they cannot be used to prevent the browser from
        executing the code.<br>
        HTML comments are not processed by the browser, so they do not affect the appearance of the web page.<br>
