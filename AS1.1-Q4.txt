List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief explanation about the tags
Ans-the tags we learn in the module is 
PARAGRAPH TAG
The <p> tag in HTML defines a paragraph.
The <p> tag is a block-level element, which means that it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its parent container.
It can contain any text
It can be nested inside the div tag
for example
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

HEADING TAG
In HTML, the heading tag, or h-tag, is a way to display text in larger, bolder text. It is used to create a hierarchy of headings on a web page, with the most important headings at the top and the least important headings at the bottom.

There are six heading tags, from h1 to h6, with h1 being the most important and h6 being the least important. Heading tags are used to indicate the structure of a web page and to make it easier for users to scan and find the information they are looking for
For-example
<h1>This is a heading</h1>

LIST tag

The list tag in HTML is used to create lists. There are two types of lists: ordered lists and unordered lists.

An ordered list is a list that is displayed in a specific order, such as a list of steps in a procedure or a list of items on a menu. An unordered list is a list that is displayed without any specific order, such as a list of bullet points or a list of links.

To create an ordered list, use the ol tag. To create an unordered list, use the ul tag. Each list item is enclosed in a li tag.

For example, 
<ol>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>
