Q-Write a short note on the tab index.

Ans-
The tabindex attribute is an HTML attribute that specifies whether an element is focusable and, if so, in what order it should be focused when the user presses the Tab key. The attribute can be used on any element, but it is most commonly used on form elements and links.
The tabindex attribute can take a number of different values:

0: The element is focusable and will be focused when the user presses the Tab key.
1 or greater: The element is focusable and will be focused when the user presses the Tab key a certain number of times. For example, an element with a tabindex of 3 will be focused when the user presses the Tab key three times.
-1: The element is not focusable.

The tabindex attribute can be used to specify the focus order of elements. Elements with a lower tabindex value will be focused before elements with a higher tabindex value. For example, an element with a tabindex of 1 will be focused before an element with a tabindex of 2.
