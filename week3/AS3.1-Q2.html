  <h1>CASCADING STYLE SHEET- CSS</h1>
  <P>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
    in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
    separation can make web pages more readable and maintainable.
